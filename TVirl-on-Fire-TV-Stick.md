# Install TVirl app

Modded TVirl APK is available [here](https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/go?https%3A%2F%2Fmega.nz%2Ffolder%2FaFVUVLYT%23pNEFZi3Y6wmSyWIsavkqLw). Only approved apps can work with Live TV and TVirl is not one of them. So there are different versions of the APK, each being TVirl disguised as a different approved app. _TVirl_0.5.3.3_com.sling.apk_ is TVirl disguised as Sling TV, for example. Choose the version of an app you're not using. If you use Sling TV, _don't_ choose that version.

# Initial app setup

If you try to set up TVirl by opening the app, you'll get an error message saying "TV App is required".

On the Fire TV's _Settings_ page, go to _Live TV > Sync Sources_ and choose the disguised TVirl. If you installed the Sling TV version, it will appear as "Sling TV".

You should see TVirl's initial setup screen. Follow [Matt Huisman's guide](https://www.matthuisman.nz/2017/07/australia-iptv-epg-files.html) for Live Australian IPTV Channels playlists or use your own playlist.

# Start Live TV

After installing the playlist, pressing the "TV!" button will bring up the error message again so _don't_ press it. Instead, use the _Guide_ button on the remote.
